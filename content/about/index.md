# About BlueHats

BlueHats is a movement to let civil servants around the world join forces when it comes to **using and publishing Free Software in the public sector**.

`#BlueHats` is the hashtag we encourage every public sector open source program office or equivalent entity to use when organizing and advertizing events about Free Software in the public administration.
