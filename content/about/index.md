# üß¢ The `#BlueHats` movement

The BlueHats are all the people who want to show that they contribute to Free and Open Source software developed and/or used by public administrations all over the world: civil servants involved in the use and development of these software, of course, but also citizens who recognise that their actions in favour of Free Software help the administration's projects.

`#BlueHats` is the hashtag we encourage every public sector open source program office or equivalent entity to use when organizing and advertizing events about Free Software in the public administration.

# ‚úâÔ∏è Share announcements

If you organize `#BlueHats` events in your country, please share them on the [annoucements list](https://lists.sr.ht/~bluehats/announce) and we will advertize them on this blog.

For any other topic, please join our [discussion list](https://lists.sr.ht/~bluehats/discuss).
