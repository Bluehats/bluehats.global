# About the `#BlueHats` ðŸ§¢ movement

The BlueHats are all the people who want to show that they contribute to Free and Open Source software developed and/or used by public administrations all over the world: civil servants involved in the use and development of these software, of course, but also citizens who recognise that their actions in favour of Free Software help the administration's projects.

`#BlueHats` is the hashtag we encourage every public sector open source program office or equivalent entity to use when organizing and advertizing events about Free Software in the public administration.

# Get in touch
