# ðŸ§¢ What is `#BlueHats`?

## Free Software in/by/for the public sector

BlueHats is a community of worldwide civil servants who promote Free
and Open Source software in, by and for the public sector. They
believe taxes should go to Free Software, endorsing the "public money,
public code" principle.

Feel free to [connect](https://bluehats.global/connect) with other BlueHats or to [promote](https://bluehats.global/promote) our movement.
