## What is `#BlueHats`?

### üß¢ Free Software in/by/for the public sector

BlueHats is a worldwide community of public servants promoting Free
Libre and Open Source software in, by and for the public sector. Free
Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve
software. BlueHats believe taxes should go to Free Software, endorsing
the "public money, public code" principle.

If you agree with our [manifesto](https://bluehats.global/manifesto/),
feel free to [connect](https://bluehats.global/connect) with other
BlueHats or to [promote](https://bluehats.global/promote) our
movement.
